      <h3>About IdyllAc</h3>

      <p style="letter-spacing: 0.7px;">IdyllAc is a registered financial institution and trademark specializing in enabling secure digital connectivity and bilateral commercial exchange between government entities, institutions, businesses, and individuals. Its core mission is to regulate financial flows, manage disbursement instructions, and execute digital financial settlements with precision and transparency.

        The platform supports payments, deposits, and the collection and settlement of receivables in both directions, ensuring that funds are delivered electronically to their rightful beneficiaries. These services are activated locally and internationally across designated currencies.
        
        IdyllAc develops and operates the required technological infrastructure, including account opening, payment card issuance, and the establishment of secure databases aligned with both idyLLAc’s internal systems and internationally recognized financial and regulatory standards.
        
        Through idyllAc’s proprietary payment and credit card solutions, the institution delivers comprehensive settlement and transaction capabilities. IdyllAc is a fully registered, independent, and authorized entity, holding complete operational rights under the legislation governing its establishment.
        
        Within this framework, idyllAc issues modern payment settlement instruments and provides access to transaction and settlement tools that enable direct financial interactions between accounts and banking institutions for individuals and legal entities alike.
        
        In today’s evolving financial landscape, digital money exchange has become a powerful and essential reality. IdyllAc brings these technologies directly to users, allowing them to access, manage, and move their funds with ease, security, and efficiency—anytime, anywhere.
    </p>
        
        <p>We issue a full range of facilities and financial tools for new accounts in the clients’ preferred and actively traded currencies, including hard-currency accounts, as well as payment instruments for existing accounts—comparable to those offered by traditional banking institutions.

        By obtaining an idyllAc card and activating the service on the idyllAc platform,idyllAc becomes your local and global payment solution, empowering you to conduct electronic transactions with accounts, entities, and individuals both domestically and internationally, without distinction. The system is designed to meet the demands of both local and cross-border usage.
        
       IdyllAc credit cards support credit, deposits, and cash withdrawals through ATM networks. They also enable prepaid payments, income collection, and seamless shopping anywhere payment acceptance is available.
        
        Accordingly, we operate within the financial and business sectors with the capability, expertise, and operational readiness to deliver these local and international, cross-border financial instruments under all conditions, across baskets of currencies—including the national currency for domestic accounts and internal use, as referenced here by the Libyan dinar.
        
        Upon enrollment, receipt of the card and tools, application download, and service activation, you reach the right destination—fully empowered to manage and move your funds across your current and savings accounts with ease, simplicity, and confidence, directly from your device.
        
        Join now and gain access to the service.

        <h2>Complete the designated form, upload your documents digitally, take a recent selfie, and submit the required information using the submit button.</h2>

        <p>The subscriber is under no obligation and retains the right to close the account and terminate the contract at any time. By doing so, the application and subscription process for the service is deemed concluded. Upon subscription, we will contact you to guide you through the subsequent steps.

            The initial subscription term is two years from establishment and is renewable in accordance with the applicable renewal procedures. Whether the account holds a balance or not, the account remains active for the duration of its validity period, subject to renewal within the specified timeframes.
            
            In the event of account inactivity, the application must be accessed and activated online at least once every three months to avoid dormancy and to maintain continuous account activity. Alternatively, assistance may be requested in comparable circumstances should they arise; however, such situations are rare.
            
            In case of account closure, all funds must be transferred to another account designated by the client. In exceptional circumstances, such as death, the account balances and savings are transferred to the rightful heirs in accordance with official procedures, a final court judgment, statutory inheritance rules, or a legally issued general power of attorney.
        </p> 

        <p>An idyllAc’s account is a trusted financial account with powerful capabilities, designed to serve all your financial needs under all circumstances—cash withdrawals, deposits, shopping, trade, fund transfers, bill payments, and settlement of proceeds arising from electronic trading, online commerce, digital marketing, and other income-generating activities, including earnings from platforms such as Bitcoin-related services or social media platforms like TikTok, as widely practiced today.

        All applicable dues and fees are mandatory, clearly defined by the governing regulations, and payable on an annual basis. If the client chooses not to continue the service, funds must be transferred and the account closed accordingly. Fees become due two months prior to the end of the applicable service period to ensure continuity and ongoing account activity.
        
        To maintain protection and avoid final closure, the account must be funded with at least an amount sufficient to cover administrative fees and should not fall into a negative balance. This condition applies under all circumstances. Any deposited value is inheritable in the event of death, in accordance with applicable laws.
        
        Adelik provides a secure and technologically advanced account solution that overcomes many of the complexities associated with the local banking sector. As an additional advantage, it enables access to hard-currency account functionality in situations where opening such accounts is otherwise impossible—particularly for non-citizens or individuals who are not legally resident through standard residency, study, or employment permits. In many European and other secure and stable jurisdictions, such opportunities are otherwise unavailable.
        
        Furthermore, we offer an integrated strategy to support banking sector development, facilitate the reintegration of currency into formal banking channels, and restore liquidity by activating transactions through this technology—addressing the root causes of cash shortages and recurring systemic failures. These substantial benefits position Adelik as a rare and strategic opportunity for financial stabilization and recovery.
